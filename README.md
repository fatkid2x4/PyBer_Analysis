## Overview of the analysis
The task in this project was to analyze the given data using various tools in Pandas to create a summary ride-sharing data by city type.   We wish to show Mr. Isualize a deep analysis of ride sharing data by city  type in both numerical and graphical/visual styles to bring home our analysis.

## Results

Reading the graph below we can see that the data makes sense.  High population areas would and should include the most rides and thus the most money.  Again the opposite would most like be true if you looked average fare. Rural would most likely be the highest because you have farther distance traveled to get from place to place.  So that data holds true.  Along those same lines urban drives get more rides, more total money, but less money per ride.

There was a consistent uptick in total money in all city types at the end of feb but only urban drives saw upticks through march. We would need to get info from riders as to why they are riding in March, but most likely due to spring break.

## Summary

Overall would like to be able to continue this study by getting a full years data involved if not multiple years.  So important to keep collecting data.  Also if we could collect reason for visits we might be able to more accurately depict when we could adjust fares and number of drivers.  For example we could predict spring and summer breaks for all kids in school which includes college.  
Rural drivers tend to get less rides but for more dollars.  I would suspect we could raise rates here a little and have less drivers to pay.
Suburban drivers could really use further analysis but seems to be the most consistent.  Something is flaring in April but would need more time and date to understand it.
Urban drivers could be used to raise rates at the right time to accommodate the increase in number of riders.  I would recommend more drivers and higher rates in March.   Again more data needed to fully understand our needs.
I believe all in all there are no surprises here as the the number of riders, drivers, rates, and rates per driver in all city types.
